# Visualization of Indian Rainfall Data

"Above all else, show the data" -- Edward Tufte

Multiple visualization techniques applied to indian rainfall dataset. This is a part of the project for [Udacity's course on Data Visualization using D3](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-visualization-and-d3js--ud507).

## Data Source
This data was provided by the [Open Government Data(OGD) Platform India](https://data.gov.in/keywords/annual-rainfall). 

## Visualizations (Work In Progress)
I'm trying to apply a number of visualization techniques to this data set, to see what works and what doesn't.

### 1.  [Chloropleth](http://deborah-digges.github.io/indian-rainfall-viz/chloropleth/)

I've used a chloropleth to show the annual rainfall across each state of India using a divergent scale of red and blue. 

### 2. [Cartogram](http://deborah-digges.github.io/indian-rainfall-viz/chloropleth/)
A cartogram is a map in which a quantitative variable is substituted for land area or distance. I've used a cartogram to show how rainfall varies across the Indian subcontinent.
