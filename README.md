# Visualization of Indian Rainfall Data

"Above all else, show the data" -- Edward Tufte

## Data Source
This data was provided by the [Open Government Data(OGD) Platform India](https://data.gov.in/keywords/annual-rainfall). 

## Visualizations (Work In Progress)
I'm trying to apply a number of visualization techniques to this data set, to see what works and what doesn't.

I've used a chloropleth to show the annual rainfall across each state of India using a divergent scale of red and blue.
